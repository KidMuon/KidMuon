## Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning Go and using it as my launching point for learning how to develop software. Today, Go is my most comfortable language followed closely by Python and R. I have limited experience in a half dozen other languages and wouldn't hesistate to write a small program in any of them if I thought it was the quickest way to an acceptable solution. I've been writing code for automations, one-off tasks, and leveraging advanced functionality of various GUI tools since 2012 but have yet to write anything that I continue to build on and maintain after it solves the problem I set out to tackle. I set out to obtain that goal in March 2024 and have since become fascinated with the process. I currently work as a data scientist where my opportunity to contribute to, build upon, and work with large software projects is more limited than I'd like it to be. So, I'm hoping to take the problem solving skills I developed and honed in earning my degrees in physics, the attention to detail I've cultivated through preparing reports for various stakeholders in my professional capacity, and the coding ability that I've built up in many months I've dedicated to learning and embark on a new journey of backend development.
